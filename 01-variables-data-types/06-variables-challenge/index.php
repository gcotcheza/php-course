<!-- Variables Challenge 
## Instructions
  You will have some HTML in the starter code for this lesson. It contains a blog post with a title, author, and body. Your job is to add a few variables to the file and use them to display the blog post. You can use the same text/content or add new content. Define your variables at the top of the file and use them in the HTML below.
  - Add a variable called `$title` and set it to the title of the blog post and part of the title of the page.
  - Add a variable called `$author` and set it to the author of the blog post.
  - Add a variable called `$body` and set it to the body of the blog post.
  - Add a variable called `$pageTitle` with the string "Brad's PHP Blog | and the title of the blog post. You can use concatenation or interpolation to combine the two strings. If you use concatenation, be sure to escape the apostrophe/single quote in "Brad's".
